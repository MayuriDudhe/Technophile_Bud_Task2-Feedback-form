Topic: Survey Form
A Survey Form is commonly used for getting feedbacks. customer preferences or requirements, and other related information from the users. You have to create a responsive and creative Survey Form to validate your HTML and CSS skills. In this task, the HTML will allow you to create the structure of the form and add various input fields for the users' data such as name, age, contact details, etc. and CSS will enable you to do the styling for the input fields and the entire form such as field size, background color and much more. Also, JavaScript can be used in the form for validation tasks like character limit for input fields, email id format validation, etc.
